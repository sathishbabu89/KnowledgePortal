Absolutely! Here's a **simple, impressive 3-slide deck** for your **AI-Powered Knowledge Continuity Portal**, tailored specifically to resonate with **Goldy Samra** from **Lloyds Bank**, a technology leader who’s likely focused on operational resilience, regulatory compliance, and reducing SME dependency.

## ✅ **Slide 1: The Burning Problem – Tribal Knowledge Loss**

**Title:**  
🔒 *“Your Knowledge is Leaving the Building”*

**Visual (simple idea):**  
- Illustration of a departing employee with a “knowledge cloud” above their head
- Side-by-side: “Before” (chaotic systems) → “After” (centralized knowledge portal)

**Text Overlay (impactful, not crowded):**  
- “47% of critical knowledge is never documented” – *Gartner*  
- “£2.2M/year lost due to poor knowledge handover” – *Panopto*

**Talking Points (you say this):**  
> “Lloyds is navigating a generational shift — from legacy systems to cloud-native agility. But every resignation or reorg creates a risk: undocumented business logic, lost context, compliance blind spots. This portal addresses that head-on.”

## ✅ **Slide 2: The Wow Solution – AI Knowledge Continuity**

**Title:**  
🧠 *“An Always-On, Self-Learning Knowledge Assistant”*

**Visual Idea:**  
- A clean 3-part system diagram:
  1. **Capture** – Drag-drop docs, meeting recordings, Jira tickets  
  2. **Organize** – AI builds a searchable knowledge graph (FAISS, embeddings)  
  3. **Access** – Ask in natural language or listen like a podcast

**Demo Script (talk while showing):**  
> “Let’s say a tech lead leaves. Instead of digging through Confluence, your new dev just asks:  
> *‘What’s the exception handling flow in the mortgage platform?’* — and gets an instant, accurate answer.”

> “Or listen to today’s key project updates — while commuting. This isn’t documentation, it’s knowledge as a service.”
